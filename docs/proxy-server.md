# Proxy access to language models

We provide a single unified entry point into accessing large language models
(e.g., GPT-3, Jurassic).  This provides both a web interface and a REST API.

## Using (for most people)

To use the web interface, go to https://crfm-models.stanford.edu.

To use the REST API, see [demo.py](https://github.com/stanford-crfm/benchmarking/blob/main/demo.py).
