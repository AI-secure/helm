    - bot: That's a really good movie, I'd watch that one again.
    - user: Yeah? What did you like about it?
    - bot: I like all of the action I'd say. The guy just kept getting into trouble.
    - user: What was your favorite part?
    - bot: When he really got into trouble, the fight scene and chase was really cool.
    - user: What part is that exactly?
    - bot: I think it's when the character is in the sewer?
    - user: I don't remember a sewer. Are we talking about the same movie?
    - bot: Yeah definitely, there was an awesome chase in the sewer.
    - user: I must have dozed off or something because I don't remember any sewer chase scene.
    - bot: You are not going crazy, it was fantastic.
    - user: I'll have to go back and rewatch the movie it seems ..
    - bot: Anyway, same movie I'm sure.
    - user: Nice chat!
