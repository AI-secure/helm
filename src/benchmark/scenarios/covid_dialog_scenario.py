    From https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/COVID-Dialogue, "COVID-Dialogue-Dataset-English is an English medical dialogue
    dataset about COVID-19 and other types of pneumonia. Patients who are concerned that they may be infected by
    COVID-19 or other pneumonia consult doctors and doctors provide advice. There are 603 consultations. Each
    consultation consists of ID, URL, Description of patientâ€™s medical condition and Dialogue."

    The following is an example from the dataset:

    Description
    I have cough with no travel history. Is this a symptom of Covid-19?

    Dialogue
    Patient:
    Hello doctor, I get a cough for the last few days, which is heavy during night times. No raise in temperature but
    feeling tired with no travel history. No contact with any Covid-19 persons. It has been four to five days and has
    drunk a lot of Benadryl and took Paracetamol too. Doctors have shut the OP so do not know what to do? Please help.
    Doctor:
    Hello, I understand your concern. I just have a few more questions.
    Does your cough has phlegm? Any other symptoms like difficulty breathing? Any other medical condition such as
    asthma, hypertension? Are you a smoker? Alcoholic beverage drinker?
    Patient:
    Thank you doctor,
    I have phlegm but not a lot. A tiny amount comes out most of the time. I have no difficulty in breathing. No
    medical conditions and not a smoker nor a drinker.
    Doctor:
    Hi, I would recommend you take n-acetylcysteine 200 mg powder dissolved in water three times a day. You may also
    nebulize using PNSS (saline nebulizer) three times a day. This will help the phlegm to come out. I would also
    recommend you take vitamin C 500 mg and zinc to boost your immune system. If symptoms persist, worsen or new onset
    of symptoms has been noted, further consult is advised.


    - How is the covid dialog in mistral constructed @michi

    Some edge cases to consider:
    - Multiple doctors can respond
    - We should throw out questions that are just "Do I have covid 19?" or "I have covid 19 symptoms?". The responses are
      "Without any details it's impossible to say."
    - Some answers by doctors are not helpful: "Doctor: Maybe. Do video w/"
    - Some doctors end their answer with "Would you like to video or text chat with me?".
    - Some doctors included their name in their response: "Dr Bhagyesh V. Patel, General Surgeon"
    - Should we include the description from the original dataset?
    - A lot of typos in patient's questions and some typos in doctor's answers? Should we construct a 'clean' version?
    - all lowercase
