    <b>DESCRIPTION</b>: You are invited to participate in a <b>research study</b> on understanding human-chatbot
    communication and evaluating the performance of chatbots on certain tasks. Our goal is to learn how to build
    chatbots that can talk to people naturally, much like another human being does. You will chat with a chatbot
    for around 10-15 minutes. The chatbot is designed to discuss a range of social topics (for example music or
    travel) and you are encouraged to converse with it naturally, as you would with a friend. For example, you may
    ask questions or introduce your own topics. Once you have completed your conversation, you will be asked to
    answer feedback questions about the interaction. Data from responses and chatlogs will be analysed in
    deidentified format and extracts edited to preserve confidentiality may be featured in any published work
    resulting out of the study.
</p>
<p>
    <b>TIME INVOLVEMENT:</b> Your participation will take between 10-15 minutes.
</p>

<p>
    <b>RISKS AND BENEFITS:</b> There are no foreseeable risks to participating in this study. During your
    participation, you may experience a lack of interest in sustaining the conversation and may receive replies that
    are not coherent or easy to understand. Some of the responses you receive may be repetitive, and you may be
    asked to discuss topics that are not interesting to you. To help reduce risks, the research team has built features
    that will detect complaints. If you are no longer enjoying the conversation, you will be free to end it at any
    time, by writing “stop.” The research team expects to learn about perceptions of chatbots from this project,
    which we hope will improve the quality of future chatbots. You may receive any public benefit that may come
    from these research results being shared with the greater scientific community. We cannot and do not guarantee
    or promise that you will receive any benefits from your participation in this study.
</p>

<p>
    <b>PAYMENTS:</b> You will receive $3 as payment for your participation.
</p>

        participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. The
        alternative is not to participate.</b> You have the right to refuse to answer particular questions. The results
    of
    this research study may be presented at scientific or professional meetings or published in scientific journals.
    Your individual privacy will be maintained in all published and written data resulting from the study.
