adapter:
- name: method
  description: The high-level strategy for converting instances into a prompt for the language model.
  values:
  - name: generation
    description: Include the input and ask for the output free-form generation.
  - name: multiple_choice
    description: All the references are included in their prompt as multiple-choice options (A., B., C., D., E.).
- name: instructions
  description: The description of the task that is included at the beginning of the prompt.
- name: input_prefix
  description: The string that is included before each input (e.g., 'Question:').
- name: reference_prefix
  description: The string that is included before each reference (for multiple-choice questions).
- name: output_prefix
  description: The string that is included before each reference/predicted output (e.g., 'Answer:').
- name: max_train_instances
  description: Maximum number of training instances to include in the prompt (currently by randomly sampling).
- name: max_eval_instances
  description: Maximum number of instances to evaluate on (over all splits - test, valid, etc.).
- name: num_outputs
  description: Maximum number of possible outputs to generate (either sampling or top k).
- name: num_train_trials
  description: Number of trials, where in each trial we choose an independent, random set of training instances.  Used to compute variance.
- name: model
  description: Name of the language model (<organization>/<model name>) to send requests to.
- name: temperature
  description: Temperature parameter used in generation.
- name: max_tokens
  description: Maximum number of tokens to generate.
- name: stop_sequences
  description: List of sequences, where we stop generation if we encouter any of them.

metrics:
- name: exact_match
  description: Whether the predicted output matches one of the correct references.
- name: quasi_exact_match
  description: Whether the predicted output matches one of the correct references up to lightweight processing.
- name: logprob
  description: Log-probability of the predicted output (for language modeling, the input too).
- name: num_perplexity_tokens
  description: Number of tokens in the output (for language modeling, the input too).
- name: num_bytes
  description: Number of bytes in the output (for language modeling, the input too).
